## Purpose and Usage

If you are a lover of Lego, you may have found yourself wondering:
`"What other Lego sets could I build with the ones I already own?" `
With this App, you can answer that question.

Search the database for Lego sets by name, theme, and set-number. Add sets to your collection. Find out what you can build with what you have.

See this [demo](https://youtu.be/45j-xHOpQgM) on the app's features.

As proof of concept, I harvested close to 740 Lego sets from the [Rebrickable Api](https://rebrickable.com/api/v3/docs/) and persisted the data along with the Lego sets' parts to the backend of this applicationâ€”[My-Bricks-App-Backend](https://github.com/DavidRMorphew/my-bricks-app-backend). But, you could add all of nearly 18,000 sets in the Rebrickable Api database into the backend to expand your searches using the seeds file. See the [README](https://github.com/DavidRMorphew/my-bricks-app-backend/blob/main/README.md) instructions in the My-Bricks-App-Backend for more on seeding the data into the database.

## Installation
To install the program, open your terminal and run the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:DavidRMorphew/my-bricks-app-frontend.git
```

Also be sure to fork and clone the [My-Bricks-App-Backend](https://github.com/DavidRMorphew/my-bricks-app-backend) repo in order to run the app. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/DavidRMorphew/my-bricks-app-backend/blob/main/README.md) on installing and running the backend and them come back here.

## Starting the App

First install and start the My-Bricks-App-Backend server. (See the end of the last section). After beginning the backend server, open this frontend of the app:

```
cd my-bricks-app-frontend
```
Run
```
npm install
```
You may also need to make these additional installations:
```
npm install redux && npm install react-redux
npm install --save redux-thunk
npm install --save react-router-dom
```

To start the app:
```
npm start
```

Now you can navigate and use the My Bricks app!

## Visualizing the State Tree

To see the state tree in this app, you can click on the following StateTreeDiagram (or check out the [drawio table](https://github.com/DavidRMorphew/my-bricks-app-frontend/blob/main/StateTreeDiagram.drawio) if you have the [Drawio Integration Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio)).
